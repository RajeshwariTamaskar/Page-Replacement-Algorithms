-Page replacement algorithm implementation

-Can handle 4 replacement algorithms[FIFO, LRU, Optimal & NFU]

-User can also choose all algorithm for implementing all algorithms

--------------
   Input
--------------
Choose the replacement algorithm that you want to simulate:
 1.FIFO
 2.LRU
 3.Optimal
 4.NFU
 5.All Algorithms
[Choose Option number]
Enter number of pages in logical memory:
[if 4 is entered it represents pages 0, 1, 2, 3]
Enter number of frames in physical memory:
[Nuber of slots in physical memory frame]
Enter the page-reference string:
[String of pages ending with -1]
